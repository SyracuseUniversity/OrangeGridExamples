This repository provides code examples for commonly used applications within the OrangeGrid cluster.
In addition to exploring these examples on the web you can use [git](https://www.w3schools.com/git/git_intro.asp?remote=github)
to download them into your home directory on the cluster which will allow you to run them directly.  The command is

```
git clone http://github.com/SyracuseUniversity/OrangeGridExamples
```
